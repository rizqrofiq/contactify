# Welcome to Contactify

> Please note that this repository was created as part of my college assignment. While the application is functional and can be used for personal purposes, it is not intended to be a fully featured contact management solution. If you have any feedback or suggestions for improvements, please feel free to reach out to the author.

## What is Contactify?

## Features

1. Show contacts list: You can easily view all your contacts in a list format.
2. Search Contact: Search for a specific contact by their name or phone number.
3. Show favorite contacts list: Create a list of your favorite contacts and view them separately.
4. Add contact: Add a new contact to your list.
5. Add contact to favorite list: Add a contact to your favorite list.
6. Update contact: Edit an existing contact's details.
7. Delete contact: Remove a contact from your list.
8. Run Seeder: Populate your contact list with some demo data.
9. Exit: Close the application.
